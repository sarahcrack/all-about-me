I started having a think about what I could work on for 100 days of code and will start next week. I enjoyed the fact that we were starting to learn how to learn and solve problems in a different way. I met my partner for the week, Sam who was very nice and has a background in computer science (and working in a toy shop!) which is very handy, so I can definitely learn a lot from him! Looking forward to this new adventure!!",
