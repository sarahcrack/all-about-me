          One day, back in 2021, I decided to take the plunge and learn to code
          üë©‚Äçüíª I was on maternity leave with my little girl, Ada, and was looking
          for a new challenge. I had always been interested in tech and had
          heard that they taught coding in primary schools these days! I did not
          want to be left behind and have Ada teaching me how to code! (I know
          she was only a few months old at the time but this gave me a good head
          start!). So I decided to learn to code myself, more as a hobby than
          anything else. I started with some online courses with SheCodes and
          most recently with CodeFirstGirls, where I learnt the basics of HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript and React; I created some fun projects along the way
          which you can find on the Projects page.
        </p>
        <p className="coding-journey-description">
          Following maternity leave number two, with my son Otto, I finally made
          the leap and applied to School of Code. I was accepted onto the 16
          week full-time bootcamp and started in March 2023. I have been
          learning full-stack web development and am loving it! During the
          intensive 16-week coding course, I bolstered my teamwork,
          communication, and problem-solving skills while completing group
          projects, workshops, and hackathons. I proactively learned new
          technologies through documentation, tutorials, and working with peers,
          and honed my ability to break down complex problems. I collaborated
          within diverse teams, continuously adapted to new tech stacks, and
          practiced pair-programming to solve problems and share knowledge
          effectively.
        </p>
        <p className="coding-journey-description">
          I decided to keep a learner journal to consolidate what we covered
          each day, some code snippets/syntax and my thoughts during this
          intense, 16 week process. I am excited to continue learning and see
          where this journey takes me! üöÄ
